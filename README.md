# Control LEGO microopython brick from a pc or mac

The python version on a LEGO micropython brick, such as currently 
shipped with Robot INventor or Spike Prime does not feature great library support.

This project aims therefor to make a program run on a pc or mac, using a full desktop python.
This gives a programmer more flexebility (e.g install packages with pip), at the cost of more latnecy.

## NOT TESTED

* windows serial paths (in bridge)
* spike prime support

## NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

* linux support
* force sensor
* motor pairs
